<h2>Steps to integrate </h2>
1. The integrator needs to connect with Airtel IQ to get the call back URLs whitelisted so that real time events can be received on the URL. 
2. Integrator needs to call initiate call API to start the call. Airtel IQ will respond with uniqueâ€¯vmSessionId.  
3. Listen to real time events to take further action. 
4. Hit subsequent APIs and listen to corresponding events to execute the complete call flow. 
5. Integrator needs to develop CDR API to listen to CDR and run analytics/reporting on his end.
